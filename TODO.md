Here are some more features, changes and bugs, if unsure ask questions, dont
assume stuff. try to make sure that logic lies as much as possible in mesh-core
and mesh-widget and only if necessary in the ui.

# Features
- [x] Store last global bpm  via slider in the config and load it.
- [x] Looping should snap to grid (start and end)
- [x] Beatjumping while loop active should move the loop, then the playheader
  according to the beatjump length
- [x] Beatjump length should be bound to loop length.
- [x] Default loop length should be configurable in the config.
- [x] Player needs a config view as well (for now with loop length config only),
  but should be sorted in logical sections.
- [x] Add 8 loop buttons underneight the hotcue buttons (in cue not in player)

# Changes
- [x] The waveform indicators of hot cues use colors, but the hot cue buttons
  should be colored as well accordingly.
- [x] In both UIs in general represent button states for buttons that represent some toggleable
  action, like for example selected stem, slip, loop etc.
- [x] The 8 stem chain effect knobs should be rotary knobs, not sliders.

# Bugs
- [ ] Solo button does not work on the stems (does nothing, it should mute all
  other stems in this deck)
- [ ] The BPM calculation is not correct, for example for my Black sun empire -
  feed the machine track from the collection (which is originally 172 bpm) if i stretch this to 149
  in the ui it actually is around 163 bpm. this has to do something with the
  slider ui, or actual calculation of the bpm/timestretch. make sure this is
  robust and has no rounding errors, such that there is no drift between
  different tracks. if i have another track which is originally 174 bpm
  (pendulum witchcraft from the collection), they are nicely locked in the
  beginning, but after a while i think they drift apart. this hints that
  probably the logic is wrong or there is some rounding errors/sample mismatches
  in the stretching. it could also be the case that witchcraft has some empty
  seconds in the beginnging before the first beat, which affects the total
  numver of samples, which could affect the computation. Pendulum Witchcraft
  alone on 149 on the ui is actually ~162 bpm (measured by tapping in).
- [ ] Round the bpm selection in the ui to ints, but make sure there is no
  rounding error in the computation then.
