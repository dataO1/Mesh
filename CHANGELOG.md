# Changelog

All notable changes to Mesh are documented in this file.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Native JACK backend for Linux** — Full port-level routing control for pro-audio interfaces (e.g., route master to outputs 1-2 and cue to outputs 3-4 on a Scarlett 18i20). Enabled by default on Linux.
- **Cross-platform audio via CPAL** — Windows and macOS support using the system's native audio API (WASAPI/CoreAudio).
- **Windows builds** — Cross-compiled `.exe` distributions with bundled DLLs.
- **Debian/Ubuntu packages** — Native `.deb` packages with bundled Essentia and FFmpeg 4.x libraries.

### Fixed

- Console window no longer appears on Windows GUI applications.
- Sample positions in track metadata now correctly scale after resampling.
- Cross-platform home directory detection using `dirs::home_dir()`.

### Changed

- JACK backend is now the default on Linux (use `--no-default-features` for CPAL).
- Improved PipeWire compatibility with JACK port naming (FL/FR/RL/RR).
